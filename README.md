# A-Multi-Currency-Household-Money-Management-Solution
Household accounts to manage and track multiple currencies
## Project Description:
Managing personal and household finances can be a daunting task, especially for individuals and families dealing with multiple income sources, expenses, and currencies. Traditional methods such as manual bookkeeping or generic spreadsheet tools lack the automation and intelligent insights required for effective money management. In todayâ€™s globalized world, many individuals earn and spend money in different currencies, making it challenging to track finances accurately. Our proposed software, Smart Finance, aims to simplify financial tracking and budgeting by providing a user-friendly platform that supports multi-currency transactions, intelligent insights, and seamless financial planning.
## Problem
Most existing personal finance tools either focus on single-currency tracking or lack comprehensive features that address the complexities of multi-currency management. 
Kye challenges:
* Updating the exchange rate within diffrent currencies
* Tracking the actual expenses across multi-currency
## Solution
Smart Finance is a web and mobile application designed to revolutionize household financial management by providing a seamless multi-currency budgeting and expense tracking system. 
* Updating exchange rates automatically
* Allowing users to accurately convert and track expenses across multiple currencies
* Automate transaction logging, categorize expenses, and generate real-time financial reports by integrating with bank accounts and payment platforms
## Target Users
Our target users include individuals and families who need an efficient way to manage household finances, expatriates and frequent travelers dealing with multiple currencies.
