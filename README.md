# A-Multi-Currency-Household-Money-Management-Solution
Household accounts to manage and track multiple currencies
## Project Description:
Managing personal and household finances can be a daunting task, especially for individuals and families dealing with multiple income sources, expenses, and currencies. Traditional methods such as manual bookkeeping or generic spreadsheet tools lack the automation and intelligent insights required for effective money management. In todayâ€™s globalized world, many individuals earn and spend money in different currencies, making it challenging to track finances accurately. Our proposed software, Smart Finance, aims to simplify financial tracking and budgeting by providing a user-friendly platform that supports multi-currency transactions, intelligent insights, and seamless financial planning.
